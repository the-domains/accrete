From the WET! Coast of Oregon...

2016 marks my 20th year on the web. I recall being intrigued with the ability to explore public access points such as universities and libraries. As one who has a near unquenchable longing for knowledge i'd found a new paradise.  

as a test post and future FYI, I began typing the first paragraph at ~0930 and by 0935 had "Uploaded" the image of Haystack Rock from my laptop's drive. A green "Processing item..." bar showed up at ~0940\. As I type it is 0956 and it is still "Processing Item..." HOW can this be called intelligent design? The image is a simple small 80k! If one thinks my wifi is slow?? Think again, I just did a speed test
