Testing again...first post was epic fail. I had clicked "Add Image" at 0935 and as of 1000 it stated "Processing item.." STILL!! I will attempt again. What is taking place now as I type is the \[backspace\] key was not being recognized in the web ap (I switched to using Edge as my main browser so Chrome extension for the.grid is no a first choice) ...FINALLY the backspace key on my keyboard is recognized. Again, "A.I." ?? Hummm..

OK, it is 1014 and I am going to click "Add image" again and attempt to upload the small 80k image of Haystack Rock I took last summer. 1015 on clock and here goes... green bar still showing "Processing item..." at 1025\. REALLY???? How could I possibly use this to design ANYTHING!!

1040 and still showing "Processing item..." wowzer!

1125 and still showing "Processing item..." Not cool at all !!!!!!!
