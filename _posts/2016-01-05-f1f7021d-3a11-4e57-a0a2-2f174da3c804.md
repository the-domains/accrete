this is a post testing the google chrome extension...(OK NOTEthe \[backspace\] key does not work in editor until a few minutes into typing. Really SUCKS!!!

adding image at 1200... lets see how long this takes as the "Web App" page that i began at ~1000 is stating "Processing item..." STILL AT NOON !!!

adding image now 1201 on clock. no image but proccessing bar went away within a minute. What does this mean. THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT INTELLEGENT!!!! No WYSIWYG ??? bogus...

put a lowers fall image up?? maybe. 

I'm beginning to wonder if the only "Intelligence" behind this software is someone at some desk processing requests at some point and we've been sold snake oil??

Image of LF showed up but what the heck? UGLY page no design what is going on here???

trying again... haystack worked this time.

UPDATE: The.Grid sofware's not so intellegent A.I. took two beautiful images and turned them into a totally bland a-tonal blob of brownish yuck! 

If this is AI i want no part of it. 

TOTAL WRITE OFF of The.Grid IMO ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9964684e-4c98-469c-8da0-550aa2d06564.jpg)
